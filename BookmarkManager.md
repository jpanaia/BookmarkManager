# Bookmark Manager

* Store a resource as links hardcoded in component render
* Store a resource in state
* Store multiple resources in state
* Break state object resources into subjects
* Create subject component
* Render subject title per component
* Modify App.js propsto accomodate new state structure
* Display list of resource titles and links per component

* Clicking on header of component changes text appearance (color, font, etc)
* Render a controlled input field that can be typed into
* Render a button in App that returns something via event handler
* Add a new subject with title and empty array of resources
* Refactor "add new subject" functionality into separate component (GO ROMAN!!!)


- challenge: show/hide when clicking header/subject
- challenge: add checkbox, select, radio input fields

- Create an input field for your "week" components that allow you to add new links to state.
- Create an input field outside of your week component that allows you to add an entire new week.
- Ensure that your input fields are controlled inputs (as in controlled by state and event handlers).
